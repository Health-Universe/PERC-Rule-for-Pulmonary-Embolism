# PERC-Rule-for-Pulmonary-Embolism

The Pulmonary Embolism Rule-out Criteria (PERC) rule is a clinical decision-making tool used to assess the probability of pulmonary embolism (PE) in patients presenting with symptoms suggestive of PE. The PERC rule is specifically designed to identify patients at very low risk of PE, in whom further diagnostic testing may not be necessary.

Pulmonary embolism is a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood clot (usually originating from the deep veins in the legs) travels to the pulmonary arteries and obstructs blood flow to the lungs. Rapid diagnosis and treatment are crucial to reduce the risk of complications and mortality.

The PERC rule is used in patients who are deemed to have a low clinical pretest probability of PE based on clinical judgment or other risk assessment tools (such as the Wells Criteria for PE). The PERC rule consists of eight criteria, and if all eight criteria are met, the likelihood of PE is considered to be very low, and further diagnostic testing (such as computed tomography pulmonary angiography or D-dimer testing) may be safely avoided. The PERC rule should only be applied to patients with low clinical suspicion for PE.

The eight PERC criteria are as follows:

- Age < 50 years
- Pulse rate < 100 beats per minute
- Oxygen saturation â‰¥ 95%
- No unilateral leg swelling
- No hemoptysis (coughing up blood)
- No recent trauma or surgery (within the past 4 weeks)
- No prior history of venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism)
- No hormone use (oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy)

If all eight criteria are met, the PERC rule suggests that the risk of PE is very low, and further testing may not be necessary. If any of the criteria are not met, the PERC rule does not apply, and further evaluation is needed to determine the likelihood of PE and whether additional diagnostic testing is warranted.

It is important to note that the PERC rule should be used as part of the overall clinical assessment and should be interpreted in the context of the patient's history, physical examination, and other relevant investigations. The PERC rule is not intended to replace clinical judgment; rather, it provides an objective and standardized method to assess PE risk and guide further diagnostic and management decisions. Additionally, the PERC rule should only be applied to patients with low clinical suspicion for PE; it is not intended for use in patients with moderate or high suspicion for PE.
